This thesis explores how support for USB devices can be added to the WebAssembly System Interface using the Component Model. This allows developers to communicate with USB devices in a platform-independent and language-independent manner, similar to the current capabilities of WebUSB \& WebAssembly on browsers. The built-in access control in WASI ensures that this can be done securely, allowing users to control access to USB devices.
